# The Currents Project

Our goal is to build actionable proprietary datasets for crypto traders and investors. We aim to set the standard for quality and usability on the Ocean Market and use these high quality datasets as a driver to grown the Ocean ecosystem. 

## Key Project Data

**Name of project:** The Currents Project

**Project Website:** [currents.finance](www.currents.finance)

**Proposal wallet address:** 0xbb397e3F90a5aB8daFd9D8b4E949546537A9d8fb

**Which category best describes your project?:** [x] Unleash data

## Project Overview

The Currents Project is all about making the data on the Ocean Market the best data available **anywhere**. Our initial goal is to create an NLP-based sentiment dataset that contains all 150 of the top cryptocurrencies. In plain english; the dataset will be a valuable resource to understand both the shifting attention and attitudes of the crypto community. Most importantly, this data will be cleaned and standardized to be easily readable by code or machine learning algorithms to enable others to build applications on top of it.

The project does not end with the publishing of the data. The goal is to establish a self sustaining business which includes driving users to our datasets on the Ocean Market via advertising, marketing, and education.

## How does The Currents Project drive value to the Ocean ecosytem?

The absolute core of the Ocean Protocol is the data. Currently there is low usage and in some cases low quality of data on the Ocean Market. We are targeting high-quality data for crypto traders and investors for two reasons. First, these users are already established in the crypto ecosystem and will be able to begin consuming data on Ocean with less friction. Second, proprietary investing data is some of the most valuable data in the finance world. Someone with access to a high quality dataset that helps them make better trades has an edge compared to those without the same dataset.

Because we plan to make this a self sustaining business, as our datasets grow in usage we will have more resources to drive more users to the Ocean Market. As these users discover the Ocean ecosystem, many of them may in turn become valuable members of the community.

## Project Deliverables - Roadmap
First Milestone: 
* Daily-updated social sentiment dataset available on the Ocean Market
* Website explaining how to download and use dataset

Later Milestones:
* More datasets (bridge traffic flows, etc)
* Sample code to use data in machine learning algorithms
* Target advertisements to drive new users towards Ocean Market and our dataset
* Medium posts, youtube videos, and other content marketing on applications for our datasets
